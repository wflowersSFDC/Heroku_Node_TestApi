# A Very Simple Heroku Node.js Utilities Sample Data API

Two key notes:
1. Mock data is provided in mockdata.js as a simple variable and can be modified as needed. 
2. This API also has no authentication whatsoever.

Both of these are for ease of setup and portability.

Just deploy this app to Heroku using the button below and add the endpoint provided to Salesforce as a Named Credential.
